# OpenFGA Condition Data Types Store

* **Title**: **Condition Data Types Store** 

## Use-Case

OpenFGA's Conditional Relationship Tuples are defined using [Google's CEL expressions](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md).

This example showcases the different data types and expressions that are supported in OpenFGA conditions and how to use them. 

## Try It Out

1. Make sure you have the [FGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

2. In the `condition-data-types` directory, run `fga model test --tests store.fga.yaml`
