# OpenFGA Advanced Entitlements Sample Store

* **Title**: **Advanced Entitlements** 

## Use-Case

This entitlements model is inspired on [Notion's subscription plans](https://www.notion.so/pricing).

It takes advantage of Conditional Relationship Tuples, which are available in OpenFGA v1.4.0-rc1 and above.

## Try It Out

1. Make sure you have the [FGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

2. In the `advanced-entitlements` directory, run `fga model test --tests store.yaml`
