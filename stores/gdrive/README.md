## Use-Case

> Note: This is only a contrived subset of Google Drive's permissions meant to showcase how a system like Google Drive could be modeled

### Requirements

- There are users, groups, folders and documents
- Users can be members of groups
- Folders have owners
- Folders can have parent folders
- Folders have viewers, a folder's viewers are whoever has been directly granted viewer access, the viewers of the document's parent folders, or the owners of the document
- Users need to have the create file permission on a folder in order to create a file inside it (only the folder owner has this permission)
- Documents have owners
- Documents can have parent folders
- Documents can have viewers
- Only a document's direct owner can change ownership
- A document's owner or owners of the document's parent folder can share the document
- A document's owner or owners of the document's parent folder can write to the document
- The users who can read a document are those with viewer access to the document, those with viewer access to the document's parent folder or the document's owner

### Scenario

- Anne is a member of the Contoso group
- Beth is a member of the Contoso group
- Charles is a member of the Fabrikam group
- The "Product 2021" folder contains the "Public Roadmap" document
- The "Product 2021" folder contains the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Members of the Fabrikam group are viewers of the "Product 2021" folder
- Anne is an owner of the "Product 2021" folder
- Beth is a viewer of the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Every user is a viewer of the "Public Roadmap" document

### Expected Outcomes

- Anne can write to the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Beth **cannot** change the owner of the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Charles can read the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Charles **cannot** write to the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Daniel **cannot** read the "2021 Roadmap" document
- Daniel can read the "Public Roadmap" document
- Anne can write to the "Public Roadmap" document
- Charles **cannot** write the "Public Roadmap" document

## Modeling in OpenFGA
### Model

```python
model
  # We are using the 1.1 schema with type restrictions
  schema 1.1
  
# There are users
type user

# there are groups
type group
  relations
    # a group can have members who are of type user
    define member: [user]

# there are folders
type folder
  relations
    # folders can have owners (of type user)
    define owner: [user]
    # folders can have parent folders
    define parent: [folder]
    # folders can have viewers; viewers are:
    # - those with whom the folder has been directly shared, these can be
    #   - objects of type user
    #   - all users (the special `type:*` syntax means all objects of that type)
    #   - members of groups (`group#member` is specifying that sets of users who are related to groups as members can be related as viewers),
    #     e.g. group:marketing#member, means members of the marketing group
    # - those who are ownwers of the folder (owner)
    # - those who are viewers of the parent of the folder (viewer from parent)
    define viewer: [user, user:*, group#member] or owner or viewer from parent
    # folders have the create file permissions; only owners can have this permission and it cannot be directly granted
    define can_create_file: owner
    
# there are documents
type doc
  relations
    # documents have owners (of type user)
    define owner: [user]
    # documents have parent folders
    define parent: [folder]
    # documents have viewers
    define viewer: [user, user:*, group#member]
    # documents have the change owner permission; only owners can have this permission and it cannot be directly granted
    define can_change_owner: owner
    # documents have the share permission; only owners or the owners of the parent folder (owner from parent) have this permissions and it cannot be directly granted
    define can_share: owner or owner from parent
    # documents have the write permission; only owners or the owners of the parent folder (owner from parent) have this permissions and it cannot be directly granted
    define can_write: owner or owner from parent
    # documents have the read permission; only direct viewers, direct owners or viewers of the parent folder have this permissions and it cannot be directly granted
    define can_read: viewer or owner or viewer from parent
```

See the tuples and tests in the [store.yaml](./store.yaml) file.

## Try It Out

1. Make sure you have the [FGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

2. In the `gdrive` directory, run `fga model test --tests store.yaml`
